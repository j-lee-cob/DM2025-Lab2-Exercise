Kit Kittredge: An American Girl (G) *** 
By Rene Rodriguez, The Miami Herald 
Walking in to see Kit Kittredge: An American Girl, I was unaware the movie was spun off from a popular 
line of toy dolls -- more than 14 million of them have been sold. Nor did I know about the anticipation and 
excitement many little girls have for the movie, which is the fourth in the series (the previous three, 
made for TV, are available on DVD). 
I still have no opinion on the toys, but I can definitely vouch for <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the film living up to expectations</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Shot 
with the burnished, luxurious cinematography of a big-budget movie</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">cast with actors who never 
treat the material as if it were beneath them</span>, Kit Kittredge: An American Girl is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a thoroughly satisfying 
and engaging children&#x27;s picture</span> that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">never forgets those kids probably didn&#x27;t get to the theater by 
themselves</span>.

about this site is that it compiles many newspaper reviews onto one page.  
Visitors can then make additional comments (reviewing the reviewers). 
Here are a few movies that are geared towards kids…
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 2**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Director Patricia Rozema and screenwriter Ann Peacock <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">avoid condescending to their target audience</span> -- 
or, for that matter, to their adult guardians -- by <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">treating their child protagonists with care and respect</span>. 
It helps, too, that they have <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the amazing Abigail Breslin</span> (Little Miss Sunshine) in the lead role of 9-year-
old Kit, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a bright and winsome girl</span> in Depression-era Cincinnati who aspires to be a reporter for the 
Cincinnati Register. 
Kit is constantly submitting to the paper her stories, such as a piece on the World&#x27;s Fair, without much 
luck. But as the Depression starts to affect the lives of her closest friends -- and then, inevitably, her own 
family -- Kit&#x27;s priorities change. Her father (Chris O&#x27;Donnell) goes to Chicago to find work and promises to 
return, but doesn&#x27;t. Her mother (Julia Ormond), in a desperate attempt to save their home, starts taking 
in boarders, such as a traveling librarian (Joan Cusack), a magician (Stanley Tucci) and a fallen socialite 
(Glenn Headley) awaiting word from her own husband, who has gone to New York in search of 
employment. 
The backdrop is grim, and to its credit, the movie does not sugarcoat its portrayal of how the Depression 
affected the day-to-day lives of upper middle-class Americans who lost everything in the span of a month 
and had to figure out how to push forward. 
The filmmakers allow the story to unfold entirely through the point of view of Kit, who may not fully 
understand the severity of the situation, but is also more aware and resourceful than the adults around 
her realize. Kit Kittredge: An American Girl sends its heroine and her friends on several adventures, 
including a Nancy Drew-ish one involving some stolen valuables, but it&#x27;s the movie&#x27;s overall tone -- the 
innocence of children, as well as their surprising resiliency -- that elevates the film into something far 
more valuable than a feature-length commercial for toys. 
Cast: Abigail Breslin, Julia Ormond, Chris O&#x27;Donnell, Joan Cusack, Madison Davenport, Zach Mills, Glenn 
Headley, Jane Krakowski, Stanley Tucci, Wallace Shawn 
Director: Patricia Rozema 
Screenwriter: Ann Peacock. Based on the books by Valerie Tripp 
Producers: Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, Lisa Gillan, Ellen L. Brothers 
A Picturehouse release. Running time: 100 minutes. No offensive material. Playing at area theaters.

&#x27;Kung Fu Panda&#x27; <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">falls flat</span> 

 Using his noodle: Panda Po (voice of Jack Black) begins his study under Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) 
By Claudia Puig, USA TODAY 
Though <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">occasionally visually inventive</span>, Kung Fu Panda is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a disappointment when it comes to matters of 
simple black and white: the script</span>. 
Everything that happens in this <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">dull tale</span> of Po, a paunchy panda who becomes a zealous kung fu fighter, is 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">telegraphed well in advance</span>.  
MORE: Jack Black tries his hands at kung fu 
PHOTOS: Check out Black&#x27;s kung fu grip 
That might not have been a problem had the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">storytelling been more amusing</span>.  
The story centers on the enthusiastic, if clumsy Po (Jack Black), a rabid armchair kung fu fan. Po&#x27;s day job is 
to work in his family&#x27;s noodle shop. When he&#x27;s accidentally chosen as the kung fu master who will fulfill an 
ancient prophecy, he must rise to the occasion.  
Despite the panda being voiced by Black, the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">humorous moments are few</span>. If you&#x27;re going to cast someone 
as singularly quirky as Black, then take advantage of his eccentric persona. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The role is so straightforward, it 
could have been played by anyone</span>.  
And the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">supporting characters</span>—a tiger voiced by Angelina Jolie, a crane played by David Cross, Lucy Liu as 
a viper and Jackie Chan as an agile monkey — are so lacking personality that you wonder why the 
filmmakers bothered to get such a cross section of talent. 
Sure, the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">message to believe in yourself is a valuable, if often-heard, one</span> for young audiences. But it <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">could 
have played out in a more creative way</span>.  
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Perhaps the most interesting character is Master Shifu</span>, charmingly voiced by Dustin Hoffman. He whips Po 
into shape and reveals his own character.  
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">One sequence on a swinging wooden bridge is a visual treat</span>, especially when seen in IMAX. But <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the film&#x27;s 
climax doesn&#x27;t show the fate of the bad guy</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">This lack of clarity</span> might have more to do with plans for a 
sequel than bad storytelling. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Perhaps children will be taken by Po&#x27;s huggable appearance</span>, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">anyone older than 9 is likely to be bored</span>.

Evolutionary thinking: Wall-E may have started out as a glorified trash compactor, but he&#x27;s learned how to look to the sky. Pixar 
Wall-E 
• 
Director: Andrew Stanton  
• 
Genre: Sci-Fi  
• 
Running Time: 97 minutes 
Rated G: <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Big-hearted and full of wonder, but too smart to be saccharine.</span> 
“The first hour of Wall-E is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a crazily inventive, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">deliriously engaging</span> and almost wordless silent comedy</span> of the sort that 
Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton used to make.” 

All Things Considered, June 27, 2008 · The camera descends, at the start of Wall-E, from 
outer space to a landscape that looks eerily familiar — and sort of not. The sun filters 
down through a brownish haze. What seem at first like skyscrapers turn out to be neatly 
stacked mountains of trash. Stillness is everywhere, broken only by the unlikely sound of 
a song from Hello, Dolly! — and a solitary figure zipping around a junk-strewn 
cityscape.  
Apparently, humans never changed course on pollution and consumerism, and sometime 
in the 22nd century they were forced to leave a planet they had turned into a giant 
garbage dump. But they left without turning off a robot they&#x27;d left behind. He&#x27;s basically 
a trash compactor on treads — a Waste Allocation Load-Lifter: Earth Class, or WALL-E 
— who has, over the course of 700 years, developed a personality.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 5**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
He tries to puzzle out what mankind&#x27;s detritus was for (a Rubik&#x27;s cube, a spork, a fire 
extinguisher), and he saves a few items — an alarmingly fresh 700-year-old Twinkie, 
say, for his pet cockroach.  
But most of the trash he compacts and stacks, in a routine that is interrupted only when he 
falls head-over-treads for a sleek robot from the stars: EVE (for Extra-terrestrial 
Vegetation Evaluator), whom he watches from afar so he won&#x27;t be incinerated.  
Eve has an itchy trigger-finger, it turns out. 
The first hour of Wall-E is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a crazily inventive, deliriously engaging and almost wordless 
silent comedy</span> of the sort that Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton used to make. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Things 
turn more conventional in the last half hour</span>, when pudgy, machine-dependent humans 
make an appearance, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">the glow of that first part will carry you through</span>.  
That and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the majesty of the filmmaking</span>: <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Wall-E&#x27;s world, in all its epic decay, looks real</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">You can almost taste the dust</span>. And <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it&#x27;s emotionally real too</span> — enough so that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a 
cautionary tale about the environment, and about big corporations that don&#x27;t take care of 
it, and about getting so caught up in our gadgetry that we forget to look at the stars</span> all 
take a back seat to romance.  
So do some specifically cinematic subtexts. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Director Andrew Stanton and his animators 
have slipped in nods not just to Hello, Dolly!, but to Star Wars and Blade Runner, An 
Inconvenient Truth and the comedies of Chaplin and Jacques Tati</span>. More than just a nod 
to Chaplin, actually: <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="38" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Wall-E, with his workaholic scruffiness and his yearning for 
someone to hold hands with, might as well be Chaplin&#x27;s Little Tramp</span>. 
There&#x27;s actually <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="39" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a nice parallel between this largely silent film and Chaplin&#x27;s first sound 
film, Modern Times</span>. In that one, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="40" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the silent clown used the soundtrack mostly for music 
and effects, not for speech, just as Pixar does here</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="41" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Chaplin only let you hear a human 
voice a couple of times, and only on some sort of mechanical contraption — say a closed-
circuit TV screen — to emphasize its artificiality</span>. It was his way of saying to the sound 
world, &quot;OK, everybody&#x27;s doing this talking thing now, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="42" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">look how much more 
expressive our silent world is</span>.&quot;  
For the first time in a Pixar movie, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="43" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Wall-E&#x27;s filmmakers give a nod to the world of actual 
actors and cameras — and make them artificial in the same way: by only letting you see 
them on video screens, where they look flat and washed-out compared to the digital 
world around them</span>. 
But there&#x27;s one difference. Chaplin knew he had lost the battle: Silence was finished; 
sound had won. In today&#x27;s Hollywood, digital is what&#x27;s taking over — in special effects, 
in green-screen work, in animation. And Pixar&#x27;s animators, bless them, are at the
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 6**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
forefront, insisting that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="44" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">imagery created on computers doesn&#x27;t have to be soulless</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="45" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Wall-
E&#x27;s images are filled with emotion</span>, just as silent film&#x27;s images were — even though its 
characters look like they&#x27;re made of metal and plastic, and can&#x27;t say a word.  
Wall-E is being sold as a futuristic fantasy, of course. But I have to say <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="46" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I&#x27;m just as 
gratified by their look back 70 years to silent movies as I am by their look forward 700 
years to a silent planet</span>.
