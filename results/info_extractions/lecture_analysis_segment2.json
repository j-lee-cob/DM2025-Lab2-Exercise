We have five, again. And in the end, after that, our average is like four or something. Why you fill in four? They say, I think four is good enough. We say, but do you know when we try to convert them to percentage, the fourth means 75 point. Five means 100 point. And when they heard that, just like, really? Oh yeah, then the four is really low. But how do you know about that? When people try to fill in the questionnaire, how do they know their agree is 80 point, 75 point, or 90 point? They don't know.
