      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

      "*   **Adaptability:** LeBron has also demonstrated an exceptional ability to adapt his game to different eras and team compositions. He has navigated the league through significant rule changes, strategic shifts (e.g., the rise of the three-point shot), and evolving competition, consistently remaining at the apex of the sport.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. All-Around Game and Playmaking:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While Jordan was an extraordinary scorer and defender, LeBron James's offensive game is often characterized by a superior playmaking ability and a more diverse skillset that extends beyond pure scoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Assists and Court Vision:** LeBron is a generational passer, consistently ranking among the league leaders in assists. His exceptional court vision and ability to elevate the offensive capabilities of his teammates are undeniable. This facet of his game allows him to impact the game in ways that transcend individual scoring, contributing to team success through facilitating. Jordan, while a capable passer, was primarily a volume scorer who initiated offense through his own dominance.\n",
      "*   **Rebounding Impact:** LeBron is also a more impactful rebounder for his position than Jordan, often initiating fast breaks and controlling the tempo of the game from the defensive end. This all-around statistical contribution underscores his multifaceted impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Strength of Competition and Era Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluating players across different eras necessitates an understanding of the varying levels of competition, rule sets, and tactical approaches. Arguments for LeBron often highlight the perceived increased parity and depth of talent in the modern NBA.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **\"Killer Instinct\" Counterpoint:** The argument often made in favor of Jordan is his perceived \"killer instinct\" and an undefeated record in the NBA Finals. However, this narrative often overlooks the context. Jordan's Bulls faced a Celtics dynasty in their early years, a Pistons team that employed \"Jordan Rules\" defense, and a Knicks team that provided significant challenges. LeBron, conversely, has faced historically strong Spurs and Warriors dynasties, as well as a more balanced Eastern Conference during his championship runs. The sheer volume of difficult playoff opponents LeBron has had to overcome, often without a historically dominant supporting cast in earlier stages, is a testament to his individual fortitude.\n",
      "*   **Defensive Schemes and Pace:** The modern NBA is often played at a faster pace and with more sophisticated defensive schemes designed to neutralize individual superstars. While Jordan excelled in a more physical era with less emphasis on perimeter offensive play, LeBron has had to contend with advanced analytics, zone defenses, and a greater emphasis on three-point shooting, all of which present unique challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Leadership and Impact on Team Success (Contextualized):**\n",
      "\n",
      "While Jordan's six championships with the Bulls are iconic, LeBron's ability to lead multiple franchises to championships and deep playoff runs, often with less heralded rosters in the initial stages, is a significant point of consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Building Contenders:** LeBron has demonstrated an extraordinary ability to transform franchises and build championship contenders from disparate pieces. His tenure with the Cleveland Cavaliers, particularly the 2016 championship, where he led a historic comeback from a 3-1 deficit against a dominant Warriors team, is a prime example of his leadership in overcoming immense odds. His subsequent success with the Lakers further solidifies this argument.\n",
      "*   **Team Enhancement:** The impact of LeBron on the overall performance of his teams is statistically evident. His presence demonstrably elevates the offensive and defensive efficiency of the teams he plays for, suggesting a greater overall team enhancement compared to Jordan, whose teams were often built more specifically around his singular brilliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While Michael Jordan remains a towering figure in NBA history, the arguments supporting LeBron James's claim as the superior player are robust and rooted in empirical evidence. His unparalleled longevity, sustained statistical dominance across multiple categories, superior playmaking ability, and the context of the competition he has faced all contribute to a compelling case. The \"better\" designation is ultimately subjective and depends on the criteria one prioritizes. However, when considering a holistic evaluation of impact, adaptability, and enduring excellence, LeBron James presents a formidable and, for many, a superior argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to reiterate that this analysis aims to present a structured and evidence-based perspective on a complex debate. Both players have achieved extraordinary feats, and their legacies are undeniably profound. This discussion, therefore, focuses on delineating the specific aspects that lead to the conclusion of LeBron James's greater claim to the top of the basketball hierarchy.\n"

      "\n",
      "Okay, so this is like, a SUPER common debate, right? And honestly, it’s tough because both LeBron and MJ are absolute legends. But if I *had* to pick who's better, I'd lean towards LeBron for a few reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, **longevity and consistency**. LeBron has been playing at an elite level for SO long. We're talking almost two decades of being one of the absolute best players in the league. He’s adapted his game over the years, staying dominant even as the league evolved. MJ was incredible, no doubt, but his career had that break for baseball, and while he was still amazing when he came back, LeBron’s sustained excellence across such a long stretch is just mind-blowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's the **all-around game**. LeBron is a stat-sheet stuffer in a way MJ, while a great passer, wasn't quite at that level. LeBron is a phenomenal scorer, obviously, but he's also an elite playmaker, rebounder, and can lock down defenders. He’s literally done it all on both ends of the floor for his entire career. He elevates his teammates so much more. He’s like a coach on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "And speaking of teammates, **carrying different teams**. MJ had Scottie Pippen and a pretty stacked Bulls team for most of his championships. LeBron, on the other hand, has taken teams that weren't considered contenders, like the Cavaliers before he returned, and carried them to the Finals. He’s proven he can win with a variety of rosters, sometimes with less talent around him than MJ had. That Miami Heat run with Wade and Bosh was amazing, but he also won a title with the Cavs that people thought was impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, let's talk about the **era**. The league today is different. There’s more talent spread across more teams, the pace is faster, and the physicality is different. LeBron has had to navigate this more modern game and still dominate. MJ played in a different era, which was also incredibly physical, but the overall landscape of talent and strategy has changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, it’s about **impact beyond the game**. LeBron has used his platform to speak out on social issues and make a real difference off the court in ways that are just as impressive as his basketball achievements. He's built schools, he's been a voice for change. That kind of leadership and impact is something special.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, MJ's six championships with the Bulls and his killer instinct are legendary. Nobody can take that away. But when I look at LeBron’s combination of sustained greatness, all-around skill, ability to elevate teams, and his off-court influence, I think he edges it out. It's just my opinion, though! It's a super close call.\n"

      "\n",
      "\t Definition \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model that are trained on massive amounts of text data. They are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LLMs are characterized by their enormous size (billions or trillions of parameters) and their ability to perform a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Capabilities \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs can perform tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, code generation, and creative writing. They learn complex linguistic patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning abilities from their training data. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Underlying Technology \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are typically built using deep learning architectures, most notably the Transformer architecture, which allows them to process sequential data like text very effectively. \n",

      "Relationship Between Machine Learning, Data Centers, and LLMs \n",
      "\n",
      "\t LLMs as a Product of Machine Learning \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are a sophisticated application and outcome of machine learning research and development. The techniques used to train LLMs, such as deep learning and neural networks, are core machine learning concepts. Therefore, LLMs are a specific, advanced type of machine learning model. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Data Centers as the Foundation for LLMs and ML \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Training and running LLMs, as well as many other complex machine learning models, requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data storage. Data centers provide the necessary infrastructure – high-performance servers, specialized hardware (like GPUs and TPUs), robust networking, and reliable power – to handle these computationally intensive tasks. Without data centers, it would be practically impossible to develop, train, and deploy LLMs at scale. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Interdependence \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t In essence, machine learning is the field of study and the set of techniques. LLMs are a powerful manifestation of these techniques. Data centers are the physical environments and infrastructure that enable the training, deployment, and operation of both general machine learning models and highly demanding LLMs. LLMs rely on ML principles, and both ML and LLMs rely heavily on the resources provided by data centers. \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",

After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
