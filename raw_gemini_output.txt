      "text": "Because when they finish their graduation, they need to fill in some graduate questionnaire. And why? Because when they finish their graduation, they need to fill in some graduate questionnaire. We have five. Okay. And in the end, after that, our average is like four or something. Why? Because they said, I think four is good enough. We say, but do you know? We try to convert them to percentage. The four means 75 points. Five means 100 points. And when they heard that, just like, really? Oh yeah, then the four is really low. But how do you know about them? When people try to fill in the questionnaire, how do they know they are agree? Is it 50 points? 80 points? 75 points? 4? 90 points? They don't know. They have their own rule. They have their own rule. So when you directly do, so very careful about it. A lot of student thinking about that number, they just average them. That meaning may actually misleading you. Okay, the next one is called interval data. Interval data is your difference. So right here, we actually say the gold medal, silver medal, bronze medal, or like five, four, three, two, one. The five and the four, because you don't know what they mean by agree and very agree. What's the difference between them? Everyone have their own standard. But then interval data is you don't need to worry about that. Because they have the same standard. Okay, for example, temperature. From degree 15 to degree 17, two degree difference. They are same. But then interval data is you don't need to worry about that. Because they have the same standard.
